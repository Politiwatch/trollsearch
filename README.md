#### Intro header

Twitter periodically releases archives of state-sponsored disinformation that it has identified and removed from its platform. While these archives are useful, they are not released in a format that is accessible to analysis by the general public. This site changes that.

We've assembled ___ tweets from __ Twitter disinformation archives into an easily searchable database. All of these Tweets are connected to government-backed organizations, and annotated with the Twitter archive they came from.

#### Technical explainer (4-6)

We accessed and compiled these Tweets from the Twitter Elections Integrity Hub and the Twitter Transparency Report (https://transparency.twitter.com/en/information-operations.html). The source code for this site is open source and available on GitHub.

#### How to Use

To search the database, enter your query into the search box at the top of this page; your search will be performed automatically after a few seconds. For more fine-grained control, click "Advanced search options" to access the filter menu, where you are able to further refine your search by date, like count, languages, archives, retweets, and followers.
